hoya-docker
===========

This is a docker file to create an official docker.io image with Hadoop 2.3, Hortonworks Hoya 0.13 and HBase 0.98 to run it on pseudo-distributed mode.

Also for those who would not like to use docker but run Hoya on a CentOS box and installation shell script is available as well.
